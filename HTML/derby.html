      <h2 class="heading">What Creates a Good Rivalry?</h2>
      <p class="text-small">
        Here are some factors that go into creating a rivalry that creates
        anticipated matches.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <ol class="list" type="A">
        <li>
          <strong>Location: </strong> Many of the derbies featured here are
          between local rivals; some of these feuds are between teams from the
          same city. This allows fans of both teams to easily congregate in a
          stadium, which can create a raucous atmosphere.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>History: </strong> A series of important games over time only
          adds fuel to a feud. Players and fans will remember important
          tournament matches or cup finals, especially if they suffered a
          devastating loss.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Quality of Play: </strong> A rivalry can't really last if the
          games on the field don't deliver. You'll notice that the clubs on this
          list are some of the best in their respective leagues.

            El Clásico is one of the most exciting derbies in the world of
            football. It is contested between the two giants of Spanish
            football, Real Madrid and Barcelona. The game is seen by millions
            worldwide as both clubs have a massive global fanbase. This derby is
            also known to represent opposing political views; Real Madrid is
            seen as representing Spanish nationalism while Barcelona is seen as
            representing Catalan nationalism.

            Many legendary players have represented these clubs, such as
            Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, and Luís Figo. These
            stars have certainly not harmed the reputation of this event. This
            derby has been considered to be one of the best rivalries in the
            past decade.

            The Milan derby is regarded as one the biggest in Italy. It is
            contested between city rivals AC Milan and Inter Milan. Both clubs
            call San Siro stadium their home, and both clubs want to say they
            are the best team on that pitch. The origins of this derby can be
            traced to a social divide between fans. Inter Milan had the
            reputation of attracting the bourgeoisie while AC Milan attracted
            the working class.
          </p>
          <p class="para" style="margin-top: 40px">
            Both teams have enjoyed a lot of success; they both have 18 Serie A
            titles. Even though both sides have been bettered by other league
            rivals during the past few years, this match still holds importance
            in the hearts of their fans. Both clubs strive to be the best in
            Milan.

            North West derby is one of the most passionate sporting events in

            each other.

            The Manchester derby is played between longtime city rivals
            Manchester United and Manchester City. These fixtures always attract
            large crowds. This derby gives Manchester City the chance to
            outshine their more popular rival. It also gives Manchester United
            the chance to show off some of the best English players to compete
            in the sport.

            Like many other derbies, this one has seen its fair share of drama.
            One notable game in 2011 saw a large upset as Manchester City won
            6-1. The "noisy neighbours" have always been a thorn in Manchester
            United's season. In recent times, Manchester City has played some
            mesmerizing football while also winning more recent Premier League
            titles.

            The Derby d'Italia is an intense rivalry between two Italian giants,
            Inter Milan and Juventus. Like many other matches in the Italian
            Serie A, this derby is always entertaining in both good and bad

            game in the 1960-61 season where Inter Milan had their win
            overturned. The rivalry increased in 2006 when a match fixing
            scandal stripped Juventus of the Serie A title (and relegated them
            to Serie B). The title was awarded to Inter Milan.
