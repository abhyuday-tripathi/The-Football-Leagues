            The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División, commonly known
            as La Liga (LaLiga Santander for sponsorship reasons with
            Santander), stylized as LaLiga, is the men's top professional
            football division of the Spanish football league system.
            Administered by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional, is
            contested by 20 teams, with the three lowest-placed teams at the end
            of each season relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the
            top two teams and a play-off winner in that division. A total of 62
            teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine teams have
            been crowned champions, with Real Madrid winning the title a record
            34 times and FC Barcelona 26 times. During the 1940s Valencia,
            Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs,
            winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the
            championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during
            the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s Real Madrid dominated La
            Liga, winning 14 titles, with Atlético Madrid winning four. During
            the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the
            Basque clubs of Athletic Club and Real Sociedad had their share of
            success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward,
            Barcelona have dominated La Liga winning 16 titles up to date.
            Although Real Madrid has been prominent, winning nine titles, La
            Liga has also seen other champions, including Atlético Madrid,
            Valencia, and Deportivo La Coruña. According to UEFA's league
            coefficient rankings, La Liga has been the top league in Europe in
            each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using
            accumulated figures from five preceding seasons), and has led Europe
            for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other
            country. It has also produced the continent's top-rated club more
            times than any other league in that period, more than double that of
            second-placed Serie A, including the top club in 10 of the 11
            seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved
            by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most
            UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA
            Club World Cup titles, and its players have accumulated the highest
            number of Ballon d'Or awards, The Best FIFA Men's Player awards
            including FIFA World Player of the Year, and UEFA Men's Player of
            the Year awards including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year. La Liga
            is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world,
            with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the
            2018–19 season.[6] This is the sixth-highest of any domestic
            professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any
            professional association football league in the world, behind the
            Bundesliga and the Premier League, and above the other two so-called
            "Big Five" European leagues, Serie A and Ligue 1.[7][8] La Liga is
            also the sixth wealthiest professional sports league in the world by
            revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, and the
            NHL.[9]
