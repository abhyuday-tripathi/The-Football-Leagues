            The Premier League, often referred to outside the UK as the English
            Premier League, or sometimes the EPL, is the top level of the
            English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates
            on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football
            League (EFL). Seasons run from August to May with each team playing
            38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most
            games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The competition
            was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following
            the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break
            away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage
            of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth around £1
            billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with Sky and BT Group
            securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games
            respectively. The league is a corporation in which the member clubs
            act as shareholders, and generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic
            and international television rights. Clubs were apportioned central
            payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343
            million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL)
            clubs. The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the
            world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a
            potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season
            average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the
            Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all matches
            is the highest of any league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies
            are near capacity. The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA
            coefficients of leagues based on performances in European
            competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021, only behind
            Spain's La Liga. Forty-nine clubs have competed since the inception
            of the Premier League in 1992: forty-seven English and two Welsh
            clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United, Chelsea,
            Manchester City, Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and most
            recently Liverpool.
