            The Bundesliga, sometimes referred to as the Fußball-Bundesliga or
            1. Bundesliga, is a professional association football league in
            Germany. At the top of the German football league system, the
            Bundesliga is Germany's primary football competition. The Bundesliga
            comprises 18 teams and operates on a system of promotion and
            relegation with the 2. Bundesliga. Seasons run from August to May.
            Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games
            played on weekdays. All of the Bundesliga clubs qualify for the
            DFB-Pokal. The winner of the Bundesliga qualifies for the
            DFL-Supercup. Fifty-six clubs have competed in the Bundesliga since
            its founding. Bayern Munich has won the title 29 times, the most
            among Bundesliga clubs. However, the Bundesliga has seen other
            champions, with Borussia Dortmund, Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen,
            Borussia Mönchengladbach, and VfB Stuttgart most prominent among
            them. The Bundesliga is one of the top national leagues, ranked
            fourth in Europe according to UEFA's league coefficient ranking for
            the 2020–21 season, based on performances in European competitions
            over the past five seasons. The Bundesliga is the number one
            football league in the world in terms of average attendance; out of
            all sports, its average of 45,134 fans per game during the 2011–12
            season was the second-highest of any sports league in the world
            after the American National Football League. The Bundesliga is
            broadcast on television in over 200 countries. The Bundesliga was
            founded in 1962 in Dortmund and the first season started in 1963.
            The structure and organisation of the Bundesliga, along with
            Germany's other football leagues, have undergone frequent changes.
            The Bundesliga was founded by the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (English:
            German Football Association), but is now operated by the Deutsche
            Fußball Liga (English: German Football League).
