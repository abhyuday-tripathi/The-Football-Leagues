            Serie A, also called Serie A TIM due to sponsorship by TIM is a
            professional league competition for football clubs located at the
            top of the Italian football league system and the winner is awarded
            the Scudetto and the Coppa Campioni d'Italia. It has been operating
            as a round-robin tournament for over ninety years since the 1929–30
            season. It had been organized by the Direttorio Divisioni Superiori
            until 1943 and the Lega Calcio until 2010, when the Lega Serie A was
            created for the 2010–11 season. Serie A is regarded as one of the
            best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the
            most tactical and defensively sound national league. Serie A was the
            world's strongest national league in 2020 according to IFFHS, and is
            ranked third among European leagues according to UEFA's league
            coefficient, behind La Liga and the Premier League and ahead of the
            Bundesliga and Ligue 1, which is based on the performance of Italian
            clubs in the Champions League and the Europa League during the
            previous five years. Serie A led the UEFA ranking from 1986 to 1988
            and from 1990 to 1999. In its current format, the Italian Football
            Championship was revised from having regional and interregional
            rounds, to a single-tier league from the 1929–30 season onwards. The
            championship titles won prior to 1929 are officially recognised by
            FIGC with the same weighting as titles that were subsequently
            awarded. Similarly, the 1945–46 season, when the round-robin was
            suspended and the league was played over two geographical groups due
            to the ravages of WWII, is not statistically considered, even if its
            title is fully official. All the winning teams are recognised with
            the title of Campione d'Italia ("Champion of Italy"), which is
            ratified by the Lega Serie A before the start of the next edition of
            the championship. The league hosts three of the world's most famous
            clubs as Juventus, Milan and Internazionale, all founding members of
            the G-14, a group which represented the largest and most prestigious
            European football clubs from 2000 to, with the first two also being
            founding members of its successive organisation, European Club
            Association (ECA). More players have won the coveted Ballon d'Or
            award while playing at a Serie A club than any league in the world
            other than Spain's La Liga, although Spain's La Liga has the highest
            total number of Ballon d'Or winners. Juventus, Italy's most
            successful club of the 20th century and the most successful Italian
            team, is tied for sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the
            most official international titles. The club is also the only one in
            the world to have won all possible official confederation
            competitions. Milan is joint third club for official international
            titles won in the world, with 18. Internazionale, following their
            achievements in the 2009–10 season, became the first Italian team to
            have achieved a treble. Inter are also the only team in Italian
            football history to have never been relegated. Juventus, Milan and
            Inter, along with Lazio, Fiorentina, Roma and Napoli, are known as
            the Seven Sisters of Italian football. Serie A is one of the most
            storied football leagues in the world. Of the 100 greatest
            footballers in history chosen by FourFourTwo magazine in 2017, 42
            players have played in Serie A, more than any other league in the
            world. Juventus is the team that has produced the most World Cup
            champions (25), with Inter (19), Roma (15) and Milan (10), being
            respectively third, fourth and ninth in that ranking.
